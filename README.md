This project is as much a learning experience, as it is a showcase of my skills as a developer.

The game utilizes a mixture of vanilla Javacript functions and React state. I decided to get creative when using either of each throughout. With this method, I've reduced the need for useEffect within the game, which is far less readable and less efficient because of the triggering of additional re-renders.
 
I took advantage of sessionStorage to persist user state in local memory across refreshes, as well as calls to my back-end for long-term storage.
